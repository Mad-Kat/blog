This is my first page that I ever written publicly so bare with me when I just use this to introduce myself.

My name is Luca Schneider, born in the first half of the 90'ies in Switzerland and currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer in a small German startup.

## Apprenticeship

In Switzerland we have quite an uncommon education system where most of the people will do an apprenticeship (approx. 48%) after the primary school and the others the elsewhere standard secondary school (approx. 40%)[^1] . Also my way brought me first to an apprenticeship as an Electronic Technician where I had 1 day per week the "normal" school and 1 day per week general education as I opted in for the "Berufsmatura" which is basically the slimmed down form of a secondary school degree that allows to go the universities of applied sciences but not the normal universities. During these 4 years that it took, I learned a lot about logic, current and low level programming. I was fascinated with programming and learned how a micro controller works and how I can say what it should do with C. I also learned object oriented programming, but it was hard to understand why you have to create classes and objects and where to slice programs accordingly. It wasn't until my last year of the apprenticeship that I understood OO fully, because I could work with C# on interfaces for some coating machines.

## Military

As you might know Switzerland still has a militia army and every male adult is obliged to join the army if you're considered fit. You can always decide if you want to serve the general public and work in a hospital for your time of service but then the time is extended 1.5 fold. With that I would have missed the start date of the university and therefore I chose to do the army service that included 100 days of basic training where we learned how to shoot, bandage our comrades, transmit messages, clean our stuff and other basic military things. After the basic training I had additional training that I can't really write about as I signed an obligation of secrecy. The last part of the military service included actual service in the NDB (Nachrichtendienst des Bundes), which is basically the NSA of Switzerland. Understandably I also can't really write about that.

## Bachelors

After my time in the army I went to study Computer Science in an university of applied science. It took 3 years to complete my bachelor degree with a specialization in Software Engineering. During that time I learned more on programming, databases, software engineering principles, the web and security. I was a fast learner and basically soaked up everything that I could. I was interested in basically everything and loved to program but I was also a bit bored and thought that I didn't have enough practical experience even tough the university was working together with the industry to provide meaningful learning experiences. So I decided that I want to do an internship which is not so common like in the USA where you don't find a job without one. I was the only one from over 120 students to do an internship.

### Internship

I did a 6 month internship where I worked 4 days per week and the other one I was in school. I was still studying like the other students that didn't work. It was really hard and I basically had no week ends to enjoy other things than to catch up with my studies. But it was also really rewarding, because it was the first time I worked as a real software engineer and helped a small startup with their duties. I got the opportunity to learn from an Ex-Googler who became my mentor and I got the chance to work on really cool stuff like a small time series database implementation or a compiler for a custom configuration.

## Junior

After my studies I started working in the biggest E-Commerce company of Switzerland as a Junior Backend Engineer with C#. I dove into a bigger codebase than ever before and I got the chance to work on interesting technology like Akka.net and Event Sourcing. I was in a team that was responsible for the product data import from all the different suppliers. It was interesting to experience the scale of the system, how slow drastic changes were and how old-fashioned the CRM for the internal personnel is. After a year I decided that I wanted to move on to a place where I could learn more from the ground up and have more impact. I felt like I was maneuvering myself into a corner and that my market value would shrink if I would stay. In hindsight I think it was a bit exaggerated and maybe a team change would have been enough to be content again. But I decided that I want to leave and got the opportunity to work in a small startup.

## Junior-Medior

I started as a Junior Full Stack Software Engineer in a small Swiss health care startup with about 7 employees. I was one of two engineers under a CTO that had some experiences leading a team. I learned a lot and worked on various systems. Brought the on-prem system to the cloud and consolidated country specific systems into a multi tenant one. I personally grew also a lot during that time because I couldn't stop reading and trying different ideas and things out that promised to be the best solution for our problems. I learned how infrastructure-as-code works, how Flutter approaches the mobile development, what benefits trunk based development creates and many more. The biggest learning from that time is the up- and down sides from Pair-Programming. We extensively paired up all day every day and that even continued during the pandemic where we stayed at home. The other experiences besides the ones in the development were the growth as a company. The hire of new people, the hard problem of new hires and culture (combined with remote work) and the importance of customers and investors. I worked in this company for around 2 years but the decision to leave was totally different than the one before. I was contacted by a German guy who has a small health tech company to be his new CTO. When I left the company had around 25 employees and they had open positions for about 5-10 people.

## CTO (current)

I started as the CTO of a very small German health tech company (2 employees + CEO) where I managed another engineer. I had no problems working with the small code base and learning how it works. The application was built by a contractor that made the proof of concept that was sold to customers. I took over all the responsibility of the development of the product and we managed to crank out an impressive amount of new features. The sales process made clear that we have a problem with marketing our product to more cautious associations that didn't want to work with a company where the data lives inside of an American company and the possibility of sharing personal data with for example the NSA is there. So we decided that we wanted to move from AWS to Open Telekom Cloud. I was the person that developed the infrastructure and the migration process to the new cloud provider. During that time my boss the CEO wanted that I would become a Co-Founder, but I refused as I didn't want to work more on a product that isn't truly in my heart and with no other input from persons that know stuff better than I do. So with the refusal of the offer I also decided that I wanted to go back to a bigger company where I could profit more from other colleagues who are better than me in various things.

## Future

I will go back to my first job, but instead of the backend engineer I will be a Full Stack Engineer that works not only on the CMS part, but also on the shop itself. I'm really exited to join the new team where I will learn a different set of skills in a bigger company.

## Salary progression

As I want to be open how my salary progressed over the years, I created a small visualization of it.
